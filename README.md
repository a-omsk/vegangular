# Vegangular alpha app [DEPRECATED]

Please look at the [actual react.js app implementation](https://github.com/a-omsk/Vegreact).
    
This application works correctly only with additional files (removed from this repo now)

  - app.key.js
  - services/service.constants.js
  - data.json

If you want to launch this app, contact me for this files.

### Tech

App uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [2GIS API] - API of 2GIS map apllication
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [jQuery] - JS library
